# Let’s start with Python

We're finally here!

But first, let us tell you what Python is. Python is a very popular programming language that can be used 
for creating websites, games, scientific software, graphics, and much, much more.

Python originated in the late 1980s and its main goal is to be readable by human beings (not only machines!).
 This is why it looks simpler than other programming languages, but don't worry – Python is also really powerful!

# Python installation

> **Note** If you're using a Chromebook, skip this chapter and make sure you follow the [Chromebook Setup](/en/chromebook/) instructions.

> **Note** If you already worked through the [installation steps](../installation/README.md), there's no need 
to do this again – you can skip straight ahead to the next chapter!

Django is written in Python. We need Python to do anything in Django. Let's start by installing it! We want 
you to install the latest version of Python 3, so if you have any earlier version, you will need to upgrade 
it. If you already have version { PYTHON_MIN_VERSION } or higher you should be fine.

Please install normal Python as follows, even when you have Anaconda installed on your computer.

It is very likely that you already have Python installed out of the box. To check if you have it installed 
(and which version it is), open a console and type the following command:

`command-line`
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.3
```

If you have a different version of Python installed, at least { PYTHON_MIN_VERSION } (e.g. { PYTHON_MIN_RELEASE }), 
then you don't have to upgrade. If you don't have Python installed, or if you want a different version, first check which Linux distribution you are using with the following command:

`command-line`
```
$ grep '^NAME=' /etc/os-release
```

Afterwards, depending on the result, follow one of the following installation guides below this section.

<Section
  title="Install Python: Debian or Ubuntu"
  id="python_debian"
  collapse={true}
>
  Type this command into your console:

`command-line`
```
$ sudo apt install python3
```
</Section>

<Section
  title="Install Python: Fedora"
  id="python_fedora"
  collapse={true}
>
  Use this command in your console:

`command-line`
```
$ sudo dnf install python3
```

If you're on older Fedora versions you might get an error that the command `dnf` is not found. In that case, 
you need to use `yum` instead.

<Section
  title="Install Python: openSUSE"
  id="python_opensuse"
  collapse={true}
>
  Use this command in your console:

`command-line`
```
$ sudo zypper install python3
```
</Section>


Verify the installation was successful by opening a command prompt and running the `python3` command:

`command-line`
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.12.3
```
The version shown may be different from { PYTHON_RELEASE } -- it should match the version you installed.

If you have any doubts, or if something went wrong and you have no idea what to do next, please ask your 
coach! Sometimes things don't go smoothly and it's better to ask for help from someone with more experience.
