# Installation

To install software on your machine, follow the instructions below:

## Brief intro to the command line

Many of the steps below reference the "console", "terminal", "command window", or "command line" -- 
these all mean the same thing: a window on your computer where you can enter commands. When you get to the 
main tutorial, you'll learn more about the command line. For now, the main thing you need to know is how to 
open a command window and what it looks like:

Go to Launchpad → Other → Terminal.

### The Command-line Prompt

Now you know how to open a command line, we just need to understand what the "prompt" is.

If you're on Mac, you probably see a `$`, like this:

`command-line`
```
$
```

Each command will be prepended by a `$` and one space, but you should not type it. Your computer will do it 
for you. :)

> Just a small note: in your case there may be something like `Olas-MacBook-Air:~ ola$` before the prompt 
sign, and this is 100% OK.

The part up to and including the `$` is called the *command line prompt*, or *prompt* for short. It prompts 
you to input something there.

In the tutorial, when we want you to type in a command, we will include the `$`, and occasionally more to 
the left. Ignore the left part and only type in the command, which starts after the prompt.

## Install Python 
> For readers at home: this chapter is covered in the [Installing Python & Code Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVTaqzKZCdA) video.

> This section is based on a tutorial by Geek Girls Carrots (https://github.com/ggcarrots/django-carrots)

Django is written in Python. We need Python to do anything in Django. Let's start by installing it! We want 
you to install the latest version of Python 3, so if you have any earlier version, you will need to upgrade 
it. If you already have version { PYTHON_MIN_VERSION } or higher you should be fine.

Please install normal Python as follows, even when you have Anaconda installed on your computer.

> **Note** Before you install Python on macOS, you should ensure your Mac settings allow installing packages 
that aren't from the App Store. Go to System Preferences (it's in the Applications folder), click "Security 
& Privacy," and then the "General" tab. If your "Allow apps downloaded from:" is set to "Mac App Store," 
change it to "Mac App Store and identified developers."

You need to go to the website https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest Python installer:

* Download Python { PYTHON_RELEASE },
* Double click *python-{ PYTHON_RELEASE }-macos11.pkg* to run the installer.

If you have any doubts, or if something went wrong and you have no idea what to do next, please ask your 
coach! Sometimes things don't go smoothly and it's better to ask for help from someone with more experience.

## Install a code editor 
There are a lot of different editors and it largely boils down to personal preference. Most Python programmers 
use complex but extremely powerful IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), such as PyCharm. As a beginner, 
however, that's probably less suitable; our recommendations are equally powerful, but a lot simpler.

Our suggestions are below, but feel free to ask your coach what their preferences are – it'll be easier to 
get help from them.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes 
support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.

[Download it here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Gedit

Gedit is an open-source, free editor, available for all operating systems.

[Download it here](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit#Download)

## Sublime Text

Sublime Text is a very popular editor with a free evaluation period and it's available for all operating systems.

[Download it here](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

## Why are we installing a code editor?

You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something 
like Word or Notepad.

The first reason is that code needs to be **plain text**, and the problem with programs like Word and 
Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), 
using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features 
like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

We'll see all this in action later. Soon, you'll come to think of your trusty old code editor as one of your 
favorite tools. :)

## Set up virtualenv and install Django

## Virtual environment

Before we install Django we will get you to install an extremely useful tool to help keep your coding 
environment tidy on your computer. It's possible to skip this step, but it's highly recommended to follow it
. Starting with the best possible setup will save you a lot of trouble in the future!

So, let's create a **virtual environment** (also called a *virtualenv*). Virtualenv will isolate your 
Python/Django setup on a per-project basis. This means that any changes you make to one website won't affect
 any others you're also developing. Neat, right?

All you need to do is find a directory in which you want to create the `virtualenv`; your home directory, 
for example. On Windows, it might look like `C:\Users\Name\` (where `Name` is the name of your login).

For this tutorial we will be using a new directory `djangogirls` from your home directory:

`command-line`
```
$ mkdir djangogirls
$ cd djangogirls
```

We will make a virtualenv called `myvenv`. The general command will be in the format:

`command-line`
```
$ python3 -m venv myvenv
```

We can create a `virtualenv` on macOS by running `python3 -m venv myvenv`.
It will look like this:

`command-line`
```
$ python3 -m venv myvenv
```

`myvenv` is the name of your `virtualenv`. You can use any other name, but stick to lowercase and use no 
spaces. It is also a good idea to keep the name short as you'll be referencing it a lot!

## Install Git 
Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. This software can track changes to files 
over time so that you can recall specific versions later. A bit like the "track changes" feature in word 
processor programs (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer), but much more powerful.

## Installing Git
Download Git from [https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac) and follow the instructions.

> **Note** If you are running OS X 10.6, 10.7, or 10.8, you will need to install the version of git from here: 
[Git installer for OS X Snow Leopard](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.3.5-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg/download)

> It is recommended to install using brew (you may need to install homebrew if you don't already have it): 
> ```brew install git```
> 
> Please note that some Mac M1/M2/M3 users may have the error `zsh: command not found: brew`. In that case, 
please follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66019047) or [this](https://mac.install.guide/homebrew/zsh-command-not-found-brew) to fix the error.

## Create a GitHub account 
Go to [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) and sign up for a new, free user account. Be sure to remember 
your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).

## Create a PythonAnywhere account 
PythonAnywhere is a service for running Python code on servers "in the cloud". We'll use
it for hosting our site, live and on the Internet.

We will be hosting the blog we're building on PythonAnywhere. Sign up for a "Beginner" account on 
PythonAnywhere (the free tier is fine, you don't need a credit card).

* [www.pythonanywhere.com](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/)

![The PythonAnywhere signup page showing button to create a free 'Beginner' account](/images/pythonanywhere_beginner_account_button.png)

> **Note** When choosing your username here, bear in mind that your blog's URL will take the form 
`yourusername.pythonanywhere.com`, so choose either your own nickname or a name for what your blog is all 
about. Also, be sure to remember your password (add it to your password manager, if you use one).


## Creating a PythonAnywhere API token

This is something you only need to do once.  When you've signed up for PythonAnywhere, you'll be taken to 
your dashboard.  Find the link near the top right to your "Account" page:

![Account link on the top right on the page](/images/pythonanywhere_account.png)

then select the tab named "API token", and hit the button that says "Create new API token".
